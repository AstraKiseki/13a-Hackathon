    Okay what I need is to make a simple hangman app that uses a quotes API so you can guess a quote and replace it with stuff.

    So it has to retrieve the quote, turn it into dashes while keeping the spaces, (probably best done by guessing a space first), keep track of misses and hits, then build a hangman.  Hm.

    Also record repeated letters and tell them they have used that letter already and NOT record it as a list.

    I have nine misses to go.
